# Note-Maker
## Deployed Application: [https://best-notes-8aef0808d693.herokuapp.com/notes.html](https://best-notes-8aef0808d693.herokuapp.com/)
### This App is created to help those who want to take quick notes and return to them without disappearing.

### As the Note-Maker app is opened, there is a get started button, which the user will click. 
### This brings the user to the next page, where they can insert a title and description of their quick notes.

### Once a user inputs information in the title section and the description section, there is the option to save on the top right corner into your list of notes.

The notes are saved under db.json where even if the application is closed out and reponed, the previous inputs will stay put. 
- This page is the apiRoutes, where the information is posted and received.

- This page is the server.js where the backend coding takes place and depending on the '.' and '/', it directs the application to different areas in the file.

## Things I learned:
- How to install heroku to utilize that app to deploy my webpage.
- The differences between '..', '.', '/' that helps directs the files in and out of folders when being referred to.
- Retrieving previous notes and saving them into the db.json instead of temporarily.
- How to utilize Express.js in an effective way that brings functionality to the webpage.
- Installing nmp i uuid to allow the notes to be stored with its own unique ID's

## Special Thanks to:

- Jen Ho, a classmate, gave me suggestions on how I could fix my malfunctioning application and with Heroku
- Trinh Nguyen, Tutor, helped me identify bugs within my application and clear up information I had interpreted incorrectly.
- Google, with the information provided, there were many helpful tips on many terms that I was not familiar with.
